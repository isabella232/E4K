# IoTEdge SPIFFE Server

The IoTEdge SPIFFE Server is responsible for: 
-	Managing the key to sign the SVIDs
-	Signing the SVIDs
-	Managing the trust bundle
-	Attest the agents.

“Admin inputs” are the configuration parameters from the “Identity Manager”. “Admin inputs” are a mix of:
-	 The configuration parameters like which plugin to use, configuration for the server API and more.
-	The SVIDs entries generated from the identity manager configuration.

The IoTEdge SPIFFE Server waits for the IoTEdge SPIFFE agent to connect. When an IoTEdge SPIFFE Agent connects for the first time, the server performs a node attestation together with the agent. 

After attestation, the IoTEdge SPIFFE server delivers a JWTSVID to the agent for future communications. Once the IoTEdge SPIFFE Agent receives its JWTSVID, it can communicate with the IoTEdge SPIFFE Server to get the trust bundle and the SVIDs.
-	The SVIDs are crafted based on Generating JSON Web Token structure using the signing key stored by the key plugin. 
-	The Trust bundle is also recorded in the common database since the trust bundle is a merge of the public keys of all the IoTEdge SPIFFE Server replicas. When there is a change in the Trust Bundle, the IoTEdge SPIFFE Agents are automatically notified.

The background task represents background operations like regularly rotating the signing keys.

# Admin APIs

## Create entries
Create entries that are entitled to SVIDs in IoTEdge SPIFFE 

Server. Gives access to related workload to the workload API.
### Request
```
POST   /entries
```
#### Request Body
```
{
    "entries" : [ 
        { 
          "id" : "string: Hash of the entry. Important if product is scaled horizontally. Replicas need to generate the same key",
          "iot_hub_id" : { (Optional)
            "iot_hub_hostname" : "string: IoTHub hostname",
            "device_id" : "string: device id",

{
    "ids" : ["string: id1", "string: id2", ...]
}
```
### Response
```
